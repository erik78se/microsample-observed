This tutorial will introduce you writing a machine charm. A machine charm deploys on any cloud except kubernetes clouds and typically involves installing and configuring your software and its dependencies, and, acting on events related to integrations with other charms.

In this tutorial, we will explore all these aspects step by step.

What you will need:

    A laptop with amd64 architecture, installed Ubuntu 22.04+.
    Understanding of Linux fundamentals.
    Familiarity with Juju
    Familiarity with the Python programming language.
    Have a juju client installed and added credentials for a cloud of your choise. (LXD, AWS, GCE etc.)
    Installed charmcraft.

What youâ€™ll do:

    Charm a small application called "microsample" providing an API.
    Set up your development environment.
    
    Develop your charm:
        Step 0: Plan what the charm should be able to do, like configuration, integrations with other charms etc.
        Step 1:
            Initialize a new charm with charmcraft.
            Make your charm install the microsample snap.
            Build the charm with charmcraft
            Deploy the charm and test the microsample service.
        Step 2:
            Add a configuration option to the charm.
            Expose the version of the application behind your charm.
        Step 3:
            Handle an upgrade of the charm.
            Integrate the charm with prometheus+grafana (via COSlite) to provide monitoring of the microsample service.

Next steps:

By the end of this tutorial you will have built a machine charm and evolved it in a number of typical ways. But there is a lot more to explore:


## Step 0: Planning
A charm author plans for what functionality should be exposed to operational users and implements that in the "ops" library. Unlike tools like ansible, where all this is decelared in yaml - A juju charm is responsible for installing, configuring, upgrade, interact with other softwares etc. All in Python code. Planning the charm is exactly the same process as developing any other application.

In this tutorial, will be planning for:

1. We decide to install a service called microsample. This service is referenced as the *workload* of the charm and doesn't need to be the same as the name of the charm itself.

 2. We decide to use *snap* as the workloads package repository since microsample is already published in the snapstore. https://snapcraft.io/microsample This makes the installation easy and workload upgrades are taken care of by snapd.
   

    *Note* You can test microsample on your local machine:
        sudo snap install microsample --channel edge
        curl http://localhost:8080
        Online

2. We decide that we should be able to configure the snap "channel" which will control which channel is used for microsample.

    snap has a concept of installation "channels", what tells us what quality the release of the snap is. Channels available are "edge", "beta", "candidate" and "stable".

This is a good start for a simple charm and we can add more features later, such as integrations and actions.

## Step 1: Initialization of a new charm with charmcraft

Lets initialize our new charm with charmcraft by creating a directory with its name and running snapcraft:

    mkdir microsample-observed
    cd microsample-observed
    charmcraft init --profile machine

Charmcraft has now produced the skeleton for a new charm. Lets edit metadata.yaml which contains information about the charm. It should look like this:

    name: microsample-observed
    display-name: microsample-observed
    summary: Microsample (charmed operator)
    description: |
    A charm that deploys the microsample snap and allows for a configuration of the snap channel via juju config.

### Edit charm.py and act on the installation event.

Now, lets make our charm code install the microsample snap when the *install* event is triggered by the "ops" framework.

*We're also adding an event handler for the start event. It has nothing to do with actually starting the microsample but could certainly be used for this if needed.*

Edit charm.py as:

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import os
    import logging
    import ops

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    class MicrosampleObservedCharm(ops.CharmBase):

        def __init__(self, *args):
            super().__init__(*args)
            self.framework.observe(self.on.start, self._on_start)
            self.framework.observe(self.on.install, self._on_install)

        def _on_start(self, event: ops.StartEvent):
            """Handle start event."""
            self.unit.status = ops.ActiveStatus()

        def _on_install(self, theevent):
            self.unit.status = ops.MaintenanceStatus("Installing microsample snap")
            os.system(f"snap install microsample --channel edge")
            self.unit.status = ops.ActiveStatus("Ready")  


    if __name__ == "__main__":  # pragma: nocover
        ops.main(MicrosampleObservedCharm)  # type: ignore


Now, build the charm (pack) to produce the charm file:

    charmcraft pack
    Created 'microsample-observed_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm'.
    Charms packed:
         microsample-observed_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm

Now to deploy the charm, create a model and deploy the charm into it.

    # Create a model
    juju add-model my-model
    # Deploy the charm
    juju deploy ./microsample-observed_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm
    # Watch as it comes to life.
    juju status

If your deploy enters "error" state, the process of upgrading the charm with a new (bug-free) version is:

1. Fix the code in charm.py
2. Rebuild the charm: `charmcraft pack`
3. Upgrade the charm: `juju upgrade-charm microsample-observed --path=./microsample-observed_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm --force-units`
4. Let the model know the issue is resolved (fixed) with `juju resolved microsanple-observed/0`

We can test that the service works by calling it through the juju exec mechanism that executes a command on the unit:

    juju exec --unit microsample-observed/0 -- "curl -s http://localhost:8080"
    Online

We have succeeded! 

*Note: If you open up the firewall for your cloud, you can test the service directly with curl. On some clouds that supports manipulation of firewalls, juju can do this for us with "juju expose".*
